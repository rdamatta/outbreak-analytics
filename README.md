# outbreak-analytics

In this project, we tried to understand who are those that went for hospitalization after contact with the Covid-19 virus during the year 2020. The data came from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and is composed of features like gender, age, ethnicity, schooling, and so on. Observations are over a million. As such, we used the R programming language not only to perform the analysis but also to build an interactive dashboard.d.
