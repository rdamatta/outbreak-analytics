# outbreak-analytics

In this project, we tried to understand who are those that went for hospitalization after contact with the Covid-19 virus during the year 2020. The data came from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and is composed of features like gender, age, ethnicity, schooling, and so on. Observations count is about 2.5 million. We used the R programming language not only to perform the analysis but also to build an interactive dashboard.
