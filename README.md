# outbreak-analytics

In this project we tried to understand who are those that went for hospitalization after contact with Covid-19 virus. Data came from the Brazilian Ministry of Heath and is composed of features like  gender, age, ethnicity, schooling, and so on.

For this task, we used R programming language not only to perform the analysis but also to build a interactive dashboard.
